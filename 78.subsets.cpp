/**
 *  First, recursive approach
 *
 *  Add single elements, then recursively call subsets on n-1 nums, n times
 *
 *  Issue with this pseudocode is that copying is costly, so there should be
 *  a better way even with reference vector in C++
 *
 *  Time: O((2^n)nlogn) ?
 *  Space: O((n^2)logn) ?
 *
 *  helper(nums, toIgnore):
 *    // Base case is when subset is size 2
 *    if nums' size <= 2
 *      return nums
 *
 *    copy nums to subNums
 *    delete subNums[toIgnore]
 *
 *    for [i in 0..subNums' size]
 *      add helper(subNums, i) to subNums
 *
 *    return subNums
 *
 *  subsets(nums):
 *    set sets to empty array of arrays
 *
 *    // Add single elements first in order to avoid duplicates
 *    for element in nums
 *      add element to sets
 *
 *    // Add all possible subsets of size [2..n-1]
 *    for i in [0..nums' size]
 *      add helper(nums, i) to sets
 *
 *    // Add subset of size n
 *    add nums to sets

/**
 *  Backtracking approach
 *
 *  Backtrack all possible subsets in a bottom up approach
 *
 *  Time: O(2^n) ?
 *  Space: O(2^n) ?
 *
 *  backtrack(nums, start, sub, subs):
 *    add sub to subs
 *    for i in [0..nums' size]
 *      add nums[i] to sub
 *      call backtrack(nums, i + 1, sub, subs)

 *    init sub to empty array

/**
 *  Iterative approach
 *
 *  Add next element to copy of all previous subsets
 *
 *  Time: O(n*2^n)
 *  Space: O(2^n)
 *
 *  subsets(nums):
 *    init subs as array of one empty array
 *    for i in [0..nums' size]
 *      set n to subs' size
 *      // Create copies of n existing subsets
 *      // and add new element to each

 *        add nums[j] to subs' last (added duplicate)

/**
 *  Bit-manipulation approach

 *  Use bit mask to represent on/off indices of nums

 *  Doesn't scale to n > 32 or 64

 *  Time: O(n*2^n) ?
 *  Space: O(2^n)
 *
 *  subsets(nums):
 *    set n to 2 ^ nums' size
 *    init subs as array of empty arrays
 *
 *    // Bit mask: 0..00, 0..01, 0..10 to 1..11
 *    for b in [0..n]
 *      init sub as empty array
 *      for i in [0..nums' size]
 *        set index to bitshift right b by i

 *  DFS (preorder) approach
 *
 *  Construct directed acyclic graph where each node connects to subsequent
 *  nodes but not previous nodes (when iterating through nums). While
 *  traversing the graph with DFS, add node to path and add path to subsets
 *
 *  Time: O(n*2^n) ?
 *  Space: O(n*2^n) ?

 *  dfs(nums, start, path, subs):
 *    add path to subs
