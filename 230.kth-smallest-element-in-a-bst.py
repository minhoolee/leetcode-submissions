#
# Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth
# smallest element in it.
#
# Note:
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
# ⁠  3
# ⁠ / \
# ⁠1   4
# ⁠ \
# 2
# Output: 1
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
# ⁠      5
# ⁠     / \
# ⁠    3   6
# ⁠   / \
# ⁠  2   4
# ⁠ /
# ⁠1
# Output: 3

# Follow up:
# What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to
# find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest
# routine?

# Definition for a binary tree node.

#     def __init__(self, x):

# Notes:
# Python returns None by default, so you don't need a default return value
# Use k and decrease until 0 instead of using a counter
# "if curr != None:" and "if curr:" are not the same
# Just use "stack" to check if stack is empty
# Study iterative tree traversals again
